### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
This app will allow users to play a game of TicTacToe with two players.  The users can place tokens on the board and the app will determine 
a winner based on where the users place tokens.

### Installation Instructions:

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
I had a week to work on this project.  I spent about 20 hours in total working on the app.  I am in the final week of Module 1.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
- Write clean JavaScript
- Event delegation to handle similar event listeners
- Show understanding of data model versus displaying data on the DOM
- Use problem solving skills to break down large problems and solve things step by step

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)

#### Wins
- I was able to get my app to function as expected. You can play a game of TicTacToe
- I got more proficient with CSS styling and got the app looking okay

#### Challenges 
- Figuring out the logic for this was challening.  I was able to get it to work but I don't think my method is very elegant
- I found towards the end of the project that my styling did not work on my smaller laptop screen.  I was able to get it to work eventually but it doesn't look quite right on the small screen still.
- I struggled for a while to prevent the grid from resizing when tokens were placed on the board but I was eventually able to get this to work as well.
